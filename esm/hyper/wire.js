// stay associated with the original interpolation.

// fragments are instead returned as an Array of nodes or, if there's only one entry,
// as a single referenced node which, unlike framents, will indeed persist
// wire content throughout multiple renderings.
// The initial fragment, at this point, would be used as unique reference to this
// array of nodes or to this single referenced node.
