// no longer providing access to those sub-nodes that ultimately need to
// stay associated with the original interpolation.
// To prevent hyperHTML from forgetting about a fragment's sub-nodes,
// fragments are instead returned as an Array of nodes or, if there's only one entry,
// as a single referenced node which, unlike fragments, will indeed persist
// wire content throughout multiple renderings.
// The initial fragment, at this point, would be used as unique reference to this
// array of nodes or to this single referenced node.
