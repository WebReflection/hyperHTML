A **Fast & Light Virtual DOM Alternative** available for [NodeJS](https://viperhtml.js.org/viper.html) and [NativeScript](https://viperhtml.js.org/native.html) too.
- - -

## Basic Example
The easiest way to describe `hyperHTML` is through [an example](https://webreflection.github.io/hyperHTML/test/tick.html).
```js
// this is hyperHTML
function tick(render) {
  render`
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  `;
}
setInterval(tick, 1000,
  hyperHTML(document.getElementById('root'))
);
```

## Features

  * Zero dependencies, no polyfills needed, and it fits in less than **5KB** (minzipped)
  * Uses directly native DOM instead of inventing new syntax/APIs, DOM diffing, or virtual DOM
  * Designed for [template literals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-template-literals), a templating feature built in to JS
  * Compatible with vanilla DOM elements and vanilla JS data structures
  * Also compatible with Babel transpiled output, hence suitable for every browser you can think of

## Compatibility

IE9+ , iOS8+ , Android 4+ and every modern Mobile or Desktop Browser.
You can verify directly through the following links:

  * [100% code coverage](https://webreflection.github.io/hyperHTML/test/) for browsers natively compatible with string literals
  * [100% code coverage](https://webreflection.github.io/hyperHTML/test/ie/) for IE9+ and browsers that need transpiled code
  * [coverage without experimental adopt feature](https://webreflection.github.io/hyperHTML/test/ie/?noadopt)

## Documentation

A proper documentation full of examples can be found in [viperhtml.js.org](https://viperhtml.js.org/).
